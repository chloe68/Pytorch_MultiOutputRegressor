# Pytorch_MultiOutputRegressor

### Introduction
- Baseline model to solve Multi-Output Regressor problems in PyTorch
- First file ('MultiOutputRegressor_baseline.ipynb') train the model on dummy data (random numbers) to predict 1 continuous and 1 binary value
- Second file (MultiOutputRegressor_downstream.ipynb) train the model on data from Kaggle competition (Evaluating Student Handwriting) with 6 continuous variables
